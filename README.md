# Design Guide for Creattek Devs

The design guides was designed by me (neo) to facilitate the development of new projects, we will have a pattern to follow, rules, and styles. This standardization of components such as colors and fonts that can be used by our team will facilitate development, making something more practical. Why spend hours looking for a "pattern"? You already have one.
